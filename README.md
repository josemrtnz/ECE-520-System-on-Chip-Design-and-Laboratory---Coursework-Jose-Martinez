# System on Chip Design and Laboratory
# ECE 520
## Student: Jose Martinez
### Professor: Dr Shahnam Mirzaei


###### All labs and project for this class are located here. This repository is intended for potential employers to look at to verify knowledge of SoC Design with FPGA.

#### Course Description:
###### Introduction to system on chip design methodology that includes the study of ZYNQ and ARM architectures, AXI Interconnect, memory, real-time operating system (RTOS), peripheral interface and components, and contemporary high-density FPGAs. Lab: This laboratory course reinforces the system-on-chip design concept developed in the lecture course. It focuses on software hardware co-design and development and hardware verification of ZYNQ systems using Vivado software tools and ZYNQ development boards.
